You dimly wonder what he has in mind, only to find the answer provided for you when he kneels down behind your head, stiff canine cock pressed playfully against your scalp. You feel the warm contact of pre-cum on your forehead, his tapered-tipped manhood drooling musky spunk as his cum-marred hands rub into your neck. "Let\'s put that pretty face of yours to better use," the husky teases darkly. You nod unthinkingly, then loose of trembling sigh as two digits tickle your chin, gentle pressure craning your neck back imploringly.')),le(ie('You gaze dumbly at the canine\'s stiff red shaft and the plump, fuzzy orbs nestled below it. Your mouth falls ajar without prompting, just wanting to breathe in that intoxicating aroma as his cocktip smears over your lips. Feminine honeys cling to his dick in a damp veneer, freshly lathered from his romp with the vixen, the heady fragrance making your head swim as you soak it all in. You moan softly as he tussles your hair and tickles your throat, his toying touch leaving you all the more eager for the dominant male to claim you.

Your cock gives a weak twitch as you reach above to fondle his sack, clumsily coaxing more of his flavor-rich pre onto your palate. That musky essence is the purest ambrosia to your pleasure-drunk senses, sealed in by the vise of your lips and left to coat your lungs and stomach. Your tongue begins to slather his length on its own volition, intent on capturing as much of that delicious cummy coating as your stretched throat will allow.")),le(ie("\"That's a good little bitch... Mmh, you're doing so well,\" the canine teases. His words are lost to you in your hungry reverie, distant encouragement to a mind set on sampling more of his maw-stretching maleness.

Your hot moans bathe his dick as his hands shower you in affection, stroking along the bulge of your neck to reward you for your servitude.")),le(ie("As you settle into a steady rhythm of sucking and lapping at his shaft, the husky begins to pump that spit-slathered dick in and back out of you. He pulls away until only the tapered crown remains within in your maw, then sinks deep into your throat again with confident, claiming thrusts. His tempo rises in pitch and certainty until his balls are slapping your brow steadily, setting a rough, feral pace that only excites you further.

Your vision grows bleary and your eyes flutter closed, exchanging sight for narrowed focus on your pleasure-riddled senses.

His face-fucking onslaught is peppered with praise and insults, mocking your weaker, lesser shaft and saying how much better you'll look as his pretty little bitch.

Pushed over the edge by these alien sensations, your cock goes rigid and looses several strained jets of seed, almost desperate to eject the cum from your testes as you writhe and buck helplessly into the air. Each hot rope of cum is joined by a tightening feeling in your sack, your balls shrinking in on themselves as flesh withers and absorbs into your core.

His knot grinds against your teeth, spreading your jaw to the brink of unhinging as he jackhammers into your throat with no care for your comfort. At last, that swollen organ pops past, tying you flush to his waist, nose buried in soft, musky fur.

The dog's arms seal around your waist, roughly pulling you closer, his cock already hard again as it presses up against your still-bloated belly. Lifting a hand, he tilts your head up to meet his, indulging his bitch in a deep, muzzle-locking kiss.
