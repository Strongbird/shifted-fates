The bed of dirt and leaves beneath you and the coarse texture of tree bark against your back provide little comfort as you're roughly orally violated, the wolf seeming to pick up the pace with each wet slap against your face.

His focus then centers on your button and fly, deftly unfastening it and tugging at the fabric. Now loose, your jeans slide down easily, catching only on your knees before they crumple to the ground.
