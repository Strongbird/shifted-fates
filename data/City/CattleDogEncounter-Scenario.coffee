  say paragraph "You happen to glance through the empty window of a decrepit building in time to see what looks like an australian cattle dog in a makeshift camp. His back is turned, attention focused fully on packing up his supplies. There's ample time to just walk away, but your painfully hungry stomach rumbles as the smell of food wafts through. You think you see the source of the enticing scent: an open knapsack filled with rations lays several feet away from him. Bold of the fellow to leave it out like that."

    say paragraph "Determined to grab that food for yourself, you move from the window and take a deep breath. You may be starved, but that's only going to make you fight harder for your meal. You take another moment to brace yourself and then head through the doorway. The dog lets out a tired sigh while he bundles up a sleeping mat. He's so distracted that he scarcely registers your presence until you're a few steps away. His head turns and his eyes go wide just before you slug him in the jaw so hard that you can hear a vicious CRACK."
    say paragraph "He howls in pain as he crashes to the ground onto his belly. His expression is one of equal parts fury and confusion, a paw cradling his muzzle while you snatch up the bag. Somehow he manages to fight through the daze and struggle back onto his feet. He turns to you and growls, \"Well, that's a fine how do you fucking-well do. Hell of an arm for a human... but lemme show you how it's done.\" Powerful canine legs carry him toward you at an alarming speed. Unfortunately for him, you're ready for it. He launches into a swing, but you easily sidestep, plant your palm firmly on his back, and shove him right back onto the ground."

    say paragraph "Pangs of hunger make you wince and reinforce your will to fight. You muster up what little is left of your strength and walk inside. The dog is rather distracted with his haphazard efforts to roll up his sleeping mat, and he doesn't notice your approach until you've closed the distance. He turns just in time for you to throw a sucker punch. When it connects, your hand takes the brunt of the force, and you reel back from the intense pain coursing through it. He, on the other hand, is only briefly staggered."
    say paragraph "There's a pregnant pause before he breaks into a fit of derisive laughter. \"Wow! Great hook there, Rocky!\" He wipes a tear from his eye while you cradle your hand. \"Ahh, that's good shit. C'mere, you deserve a little something for that laugh.\" Powerful paws grab a hold of you and throw you to the ground onto your belly. He then promptly straddles your ass, the weight of his body keeping you pinned to the floor beneath him."

Kick: =>
  say paragraph "You give a rough kick to his ribs that earns another yelp from the cattle dog before he curls up defensively. Just to be sure he doesn't try anything while you leave, you watch him on your way out, then put good distance between yourself and the building before you check your loot."

    say paragraph "Opportunity calls, and you are eager to answer. With a little extra caution to quiet your steps, it's criminally easy to sneak through the doorway and reach the bag while the dog struggles to roll up a sleeping mat. You delicately lift the knapsack from the floor without a sound. Before you step away, you realize that there's more around his camp than what you first saw. Various salvage is scattered about that could prove useful: Fresh water bottles sit near a primitive filter, scrap metal is laid out neatly on a cloth, and there's still a bindle of who-knows-what waiting to be snatched."
    say paragraph "Unfortunately, your traitorous stomach growls at the very concept of delaying your meal. The sound makes the cattle dog's ears perk, and you take that as the signal to make your retreat before he can turn around. Once you're well clear of the building, you examine the contents of the knapsack."
  else
    say paragraph "You decide to snatch the knapsack and bail before the dog catches wind of your subterfuge. Steadying your breath, you crouch low to sneak through the doorframe. You realize your mistake too late when you step on a loose piece of slime-covered cloth and tumble forwards, causing you to fall onto a little pile of neatly sorted scrap on a blanket. Your graceless pratfall sends it flying in all directions with a cacophany of metal clangs, and you accidentally tangle yourself up in the blanket when you try to get back on your feet. Once you manage to stand upright, partway bound in cloth that conceals your face and blocks your vision, you run back towards where the door should be. You kick innumerable small objects on the way, then hit the frame dead-on and fall straight onto your ass."
    say paragraph "Despite being dazed from the impact, you find yourself surprised that nothing happens for a long, long moment. You then hear a single clap. Then another. Slowly, it increases in tempo until you're on the receiving end of a standing ovation. Cruel laughter joins in as the sound of footsteps grows near. \"Bravo! Bra-vo! What a show, really.\" Your cover is yanked away, and you find yourself peering up at the cattle dog's grinning face. \"Well, pal, you make a mess of my stuff, I make a mess of you. Fair's fair, right?\" He points down, and your gaze is drawn to his red, vein-lined doggy dick, his bestial shaft complete with a bitch-breaking knot and a plump, fuzzy sheath. He rolls your prone body onto your belly, then takes position atop you to straddle your ass and pin you down."

The dog doesn't notice you until you clear your throat, which startles the hell out of him and makes him jump so hard he nearly topples over. He turns to you with a glare that softens at the sight of your human form. \"Who the hell are... oh. Well, that's a rare sight.\""

    say paragraph "You explain that you found his camp and thought he could use some company. He just chuckles at the notion. \"Really? Your kind really ought to stay far away from mine, if you know what's good for you.\" He stops folding the mat and opts instead to settle down on it. \"But you obviously don't. You know what? Why not!\" He makes a vague, noncommittal gesture with his hand. \"Have a seat wherever, it's gonna be uncomfortable no matter where you pick. Welcome to my camp, I guess.\" You settle down nearby and ask him what he's doing around this part of the city with so many supplies."
    say paragraph "\"Well, not that it's any business of yours... buuut, I'm mostly just scavenging extra supplies for the Pack. Scrap metal and electronics, the rare bit of old food that hasn't gone bad - that sort of thing. More the former than the latter.\" He nods towards the knapsack of rations. \"Already loaded up on meal bars before I came. Last thing I'd ever want is to be stuck out here hungry. Y'know, you're looking kinda thin yourself.\" The cattle dog gives you a once-over, and you do the same. He's built like an athlete and has a healthy sheen to his brown and black mottled fur, flecked with the grizzled gray and white of age. There's not a shred of clothes covering his body. Your eyes are inevitably drawn between his legs, where a plump and inviting sheath lies, though you look away just as quickly."
    say paragraph "He crosses his arms over his powerful chest and tilts his head as curious dogs often do. \"My turn, though. How'd you end up out here? Hell, better question: How are you not somebody's slave or pet yet?\" He draws a thumb across his jaw in thought. \"Can't remember the last time I saw a human that wasn't about to be railed into something else.\" His eyes narrow. \"Can't remember the last time I... was... hm,\" he trails off. You tell him about how you woke up, then about how circumstances led to your current struggle with starvation. He lets out a long sigh. \"Ahhh, hell. No wonder you decided to stop by an old dog's camp! Must be so hungry you can't think straight.\" There's an awkward silence that lasts for all of a few seconds before he clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth in frustration."
    say paragraph "\"Tell you what, kid. You've made my day a little better, and that's hard to do lately. I think that's worth more than a few bars. S'all I've got to spare.\" He stands, and goodness he is very, very tall. He goes over to his knapsack and pulls it open, sorting through it until he comes back with a small wealth of rations to shove into your arms. \"I gotta get going soon, and so should you. Not everyone you meet is going to be this nice. World's gone to hell, and I'd hate to see it eat another good soul up. Now go on - get!\" He literally pushes you out the door and waves you off, leaving you to check your 'earnings' on your own."

  else
    say paragraph "Your mind races with thoughts of food, making it difficult to focus despite your best attempts to keep it together. As you fumble through a haphazard explanation of your situation and ask as politely as you can for some of his rations, you mostly just earn a skeptical glare from the cattle dog. \"That's it, huh? Fuckin' hell, first human I see in who knows how long and you're just some sorry beggar.\" He pinches the bridge of his snout and shakes his head in irritation. It looks like he's primed to start yelling you out of his camp, but then he forms a devious grin. The tension in his body relaxes away with a terrible chuckle that causes the hair on your neck to stand on end."
    say paragraph "\"You know what? I have an idea that'll make both of us happy.\" You half expect to have to run when he stands up - and up, and up. He's so tall! Instead, he walks right past you and over to the knapsack, yanking it open and pulling out a couple bars of food that would more than fill your aching belly. He grins toothily and waves them at you. \"This what you're after, freeloader?\" Your stomach rumbles noisily before you can even reply, and he rolls his head back in laughter. \"Good enough for me!\" Rather than walking towards you, however, he heads to the doorframe to block it. A knot swells in your gut. You fear it may not be the only one for long."
    say paragraph "Watching you intently, the canine unwraps each bar, then tosses them on the dirty floor. You stand there, horrified, as he reaches below to coax his intensely thick, slick and shiny red doggy dick from its plump and fuzzy sheath, not wasting a second before he makes his plans clear. Lightly furred digits wrap around his crimson length firmly enough to skindent its otherwise rigid, densely vein-lined flesh. He crouches over the food and starts stroking himself off from knot to tapered tip, and you're helpless but to watch thick, sloppy strands of prespunk drool from his tip and right onto your future meal."
    say paragraph "There's a moment of panic where you search for any kind of exit, any escape or weakness you might be able to exploit, but there's nothing. Even the window is more likely to get you stuck and fucked than much else. \"Eyes on the meal, whore. Be grateful for my generosity,\" he growls to you. You give the food another look, and it seems like they've become twice as damp and sticky with his pre in the few seconds that you looked away. From the way he groans and the way his knot inflates and flexes, it seems like the real deal isn't far off."
    say paragraph "Sure enough, in the next moment he rolls his head back and grits his teeth to muffle a long howl of pleasure. The thick bulge of his knot flares out, and a hard surge rolls through his length from base to tip before a massive, messy jet of hot canine cum utterly soaks the food in splatters of pearly spunk, shortly followed by much, much more. The sticky deluge smells strongly of his masculine virility, a potent musk about it that stains your sodden meal as much as the air you take in with shuddering breaths. You wince, but as much as you hate to admit it, hunger overwhelms your disgust. The cattle dog pants and huffs as the last of his load gushes out. Once he's done, he nearly collapses against the frame of the doorway, but he finds his composure again too quickly to exploit his moment of weakness."
    say paragraph "His wicked grin returns, and he gestures toward the cum-soaked ration bars. \"Bon appetit. You can leave when you've eaten every crumb.\" There's no getting out of this. You swallow hard."

  say paragraph "You start to walk toward your meal, but he barks viciously and points at the ground. \"Nope. All fours, now.\" You glower at him, but he only grins like the smug bastard he is, and you lower yourself onto your hands and knees as requested. Slowly, you crawl your way over until your head is hovering over the sticky mess of what was once perfectly edible food. Granted, it's technically even more nutritious now than it was before, but that doesn't exactly make you feel better about the webs and lines of spunk all over it. Dignity means little to the painful pangs of hunger which draw you onwards almost as much as the threat of angering the cattle dog."
  say paragraph "There's a moment of hesitation where you look between him and the food. He simply smirks down at you. \"What are you waiting for? It's just some protein bars. Dig in.\" You sigh loudly at his words, then lower your face down for a tentative taste. The first thing to greet your palate is the salty, musky flavor of canine cream. Your initial reaction is one of immediate revulsion, and you yank your head back, but the taste sticks to your tastebuds and refuses to leave. Try as you might to ignore it, it's only a moment before you realize that it's not nearly as unpleasant as you expected."
  say paragraph "The dog breaks out into a fit of derisive laughter. \"I've seen that look before. Trust me, it only gets better, and you've got a looong way to go.\" He steps forwards and cracks his knuckles. \"Here, let me help.\" The padded heel of his footpaw presses into the back of your head and roughly forces your face back down, his seed drenching your face as you breathe in the aroma of cum-glazed granola. You whine up at him, and he barks his annoyed reply. \"Eat that or eat concrete, your choice.\""
  say paragraph "With one last grumble, you open your mouth to take a bite out of your soaked meal. You can't really tell if the bar itself is tasteless or if it's just that saturated in the dog's cum, but it doesn't have a very distinct flavor; it mostly just serves as a vessel for heady canine essence, the now mushy texture helping it stick to your tongue and the roof of your mouth, gooey strands bridging the two together. It's hard not to focus on the musk-laden taste while you chew - not that you're entirely certain you want to stop, to your rapidly building shame. The dog grinds his heel firmly against the back of your head to press you down for more, and you find your reservations melting away under the humiliating assault."
  say paragraph "By the time you've scarfed everything down, the hunger in your belly is at least somewhat sated. \"There you go, bitch. Hope that was enough, because I'm not wasting any more on you.\" You nod meekly in response to his words, feeling so ashamed of yourself for following through on something so repulsive. There's no denying the latent arousal coursing through you, some baser part savoring the lingering, cloying taste of his cum in your mouth, a slimy sheen of seed that fills your every breath and causes a dull throb in your loins."
  say paragraph "He picks you up by the scruff of your neck and carelessly tosses you out the door, your body hitting the pavement with a dull thud. You cry out from the pain of the impact. By the time you look back to glare at him, the cattle dog's already shut the door on you, not even sparing his plaything another glance. You stagger up to your feet and clutch your throbbing head. As you walk away, you realize that despite your belly being full again, you can't seem to stop licking your lips..."
