    say paragraph "Of all the rooms in the observatory, the restrooms feel the most ordinary, following the tried and true layout of sinks on one side, stalls on the other. Above the sinks hangs a wall-length mirror, the reflective surface making the room feel larger than it really is. A larger handicapped stall has been installed in the back of the room for ADA compliance, two changing tables allow mothers to take care of their toddlers' needs, and wall-mounted hand dryers mitigate unnecessary paper waste. There's a faint lemon odor in the air, most likely sprayed to keep the area smelling fresh throughout the day."
