    say paragraph "Of all the rooms in the observatory, the restrooms feel the most ordinary, following the tried and true layout of sinks on one side, stalls on the other. Above the sinks hangs a wall-length mirror, the reflective surface making the room feel larger than it really is. A larger handicapped stall has been installed in the back of the room, and some changing tables and hand dryers have been mounted to the wall. There's a faint lemon odor in the air, most likely sprayed to keep the area smelling fresh throughout the day."
