    say paragraph "The restrooms follow the tried and true layout of sinks on one side, urinals and stalls on the other. Above the sinks is a wall-length mirror, the reflective surface making the room feel larger than it really is. A larger handicapped stall has been installed in the back of the room, and several hand dryers have been mounted on the wall. There's a faint lemon odor in the air, most likely sprayed to keep the area smelling fresh throughout the day."
