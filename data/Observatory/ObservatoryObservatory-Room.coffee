    say paragraph "Taking stock of your surroundings, you seem to be standing in a narrow pod with metal walls and a single glass window. The tight, enclosed space almost instantly makes you feel claustrophobic. You press your hands against the glass, and to your surprise, the pane comes loose easily, falling right off its frame and shattering across the concrete floor."
    say paragraph "You carefully climb out the pod and into what looks to be the main room of an observatory. The center of the space is dominated by an enormous telescope. The ceiling above it is a great dome of metal with curved steel rafters for support. An opening between the two halves allows sunlight to stream in freely."
    say paragraph "Given the state you woke up in, it's clear that this place has been converted into something much different than its original design. The machines around you are certainly unlike anything you've ever seen. Strange, faintly glowing crystals power devices made from alloys and plastics. Most of the equipment appears to be in a state of disrepair, several devices strewn across the floor and others completely smashed to pieces."
    say paragraph "The only exit out of this room is a wooden door to the south, currently standing ajar."

    say paragraph "The room you woke up in feels eerie to return to. The equipment doesn't seem to have been touched since you were last here, and the floor is still covered in glass from when you broke out of the containment pod."
