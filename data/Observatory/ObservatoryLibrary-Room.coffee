    say paragraph "Little light passes through to the library, shrouding most of the area in darkness. From what you can see, there's rows upon rows of fully-stocked bookshelves. All of the material here appears to be nonfiction centered around astronomy. There's biographies of famous historical figures, the history of technological advances in the field, a section of journals pertaining to the discovery of new celestial bodies, and even a popular science section for the general public. The air here is musty with the scent of old paper."
